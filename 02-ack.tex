I want to give my warmest thanks to my supervisor, professor Sauleh Etemadi, Who made this project possible. He fully supports me and guides me. He also led me in each stage of writing this report.  

Specially thanks to my mother, father, and my sister, who support me every single day of my life. They always motivate me in this way.

I am also thankful for my teammates and my friends Mr. Majid Zarharan, Mr. Mehdi Moghadami, Mr. Armin Gholampoor, and Miss Zahra Hosseini. They helped me to improve this project and suggest me important advice. 

Finally, Thank God for letting me through all these hard days and give me such power to finish this work. I keep trusting you for my future.
